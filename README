# Web3 Storage Speed Test

Web3 Storage Speed Test is a tool designed for testing the speed and reliability of uploading data to distributed storage networks, particularly focused on Swarm and related technologies.

## Overview

Web3 Storage Speed Test is a Python script that utilizes various libraries and APIs to perform the following tasks:

- Generate random JSON data of a specified size.
- Upload the generated data to a specified URL.
- Perform HTTP and SSH requests to retrieve the uploaded data and verify its integrity.
- Measure and record various metrics related to the upload and retrieval process.
- Push metrics to a Prometheus Pushgateway for monitoring and analysis.

## Dependencies

Web3 Storage Speed Test relies on several Python libraries, including but not limited to:

- `asyncio` for asynchronous I/O operations.
- `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `asyncssh` for asynchronous SSH connections.
- `prometheus_client` for collecting and exposing metrics.
- `ipinfo` for retrieving IP geolocation information.

Additionally, external tools such as `curl` and `jq` are used for specific tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Configure the script by modifying the `config.json` file and setting environment variables as needed.
5. Run the script using the appropriate command-line arguments to perform upload and testing tasks.

## Usage

```bash
python3 web3_storage_speed_test.py --url <UPLOAD_URL> --size <DATA_SIZE_IN_KB> [--repeat <REPEAT_COUNT>] [--continuous] [--upload]

example: python3 app.py --url https://bee-1.fairdatasociety.org/bzz --upload
